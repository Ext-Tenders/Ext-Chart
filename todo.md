UI work
=======
- [ ] allow manual specification of differentials
- [ ] allow control over which bases are used to display a particular EXTTerm


backend work
============
- [ ] add entire polynomial families at once, propagate products with existing classes
- [ ] allow for a SS to be a module over another SS of algebras
- [ ] allow for a partially defined multiplicative structure
- [ ] handle stretching the window well, i.e., make the recalculation of the newly uncovered part of the SS computationally unintensive
- [ ] handle adding dimensions to the spectral sequence sanely --- right now the differentials and multiplicative structure matrices are unlinked in every real way to the EXTTerm they belong to, which means things can get badly out of sync.


goals
=====
- [ ] automatic computation of May SS
    + [ ] subgoal: get it to automatically compute Ext_A(1)(k, k).  the relevant filtration for A(1) looks like E[Q1] --> A(1) --> E[Sq1, Sq2] / Q1.  dually, this looks like F2[xi2] / xi2^2 <-- F2[xi1, xi2] / etc <-- F2[x1] / x1^4.  Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre computes the Ext over these two corner coalgebras as F2[v1] and F2[h0, h1] respectively.
    + [ ] subgoal: then, try Ext_A(2)(k, k).
- [ ] automatic propagation of differentials via...
    + Leibniz rule
    + Steenrod structure in the May and Serre spectral sequences


some other questions
====================
 + are there existing software packages for computing E_2^MSS?
 + should we perform internal consistency checks?

flowcharts for some other things
================================
When adding a fresh differential:
 + Modify the matrix of differentials
 + Iterate through the other terms
      + Multiply them together and apply the Leibniz rule
      + Apply the various squaring operations and Kudo's rule
      + Act by some ring and apply linearity.

When modifying the product structure of existing classes:
 + Check the Leibniz / Kudo / linearity rules.
 + If they matchâ€¦
      + do nothing.
      + otherwise, ask what to do.
      + If we're told to accept a new definition, modify the differential and propagate.

Introducing a polynomial class:
 + Build the truncated polynomial algebra separately, P.
 + Build EXTTerms for all the tensor pairs A (x) P.
    ... and store these separately.
 + Iterate over pairs of existing terms;
    use the old multiplication tables to build new ones: (a|p)(a'|p') = aa'|pp'
    use old differentials to build new ones: d(a|p) = da|p + a|dp.
 + Discard / release all the old terms, differentials, tables.
 + Store the new ones.
 + Cycle through the pages to perform boundary/cycle computations.
 
Keep in mind the tensor ordering convention:
    e1 | f1, e1 | f2, e2 | f1, e2 | f2.
