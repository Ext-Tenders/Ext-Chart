{"name":"Ext-chart","tagline":"Compute and draw spectral sequences","body":"# Ext Chart\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to facilitate the drawing and manipulation of spectral sequences, by tracking the differential and multiplicative structures across pages of a given spectral sequence.\r\n\r\nExt Chart is open source software released under the [University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License](http://opensource.org/licenses/NCSA).\r\n\r\nDiscussion on Freenode at #Ext-Chart.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n\r\nNone yet.\r\n\r\n### Demos\r\n\r\nNone yet.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nUse Xcode to download the Ext Chart repository from GitHub:\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode and choose the Source Control > Check Out… menu item\r\n2. Type **https://github.com/ecpeterson/Ext-Chart.git** in the repository location field and click Next\r\n3. Select a folder in your disk where the project repository will be stored and click Check Out.\r\n\r\n    Xcode will download the repository. Since we use third-party projects, Xcode will also ask you to check out each third-party project as an additional working copy. Choose Check Out… and click Next so that Xcode downloads all dependent projects.\r\n\r\n4. We need to use a shared build folder for all projects in the workspace. Since this is an individual setting, you need to configure it in your system. In Xcode, choose the File > Workspace Settings… menu item. Click Advanced…, choose Shared Folder and type a folder name—we suggest ExtChartBuild.\r\n\r\nWhen restarting Xcode, make sure you open Ext Chart’s workspace instead of its project.\r\n","google":"UA-53291502-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
