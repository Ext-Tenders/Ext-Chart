# Ext Chart

The goal of this project is to facilitate the drawing and manipulation of spectral sequences, by tracking the differential and multiplicative structures across pages of a given spectral sequence.

Ext Chart is open source software released under the [University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License](http://opensource.org/licenses/NCSA).

We’re happy to talk about this project on Freenode at #Ext-Chart.
